Step 3: Identify a dataset you want to work with for the capstone project

This course follows the principle of ""open by default"". All educational resources are published openly using permissive licenses for reuse. We also apply this principle to the code and data used in the course.

At the end of the course, you will complete a capstone project, which involves analyzing a dataset of your choice. We encourage you to use data available from your company, government institution, research institute, or other personal sources. However, this requires the data to be shared openly, which may not always be possible if it is sensitive or contains personal information. In such cases, you may use a dataset that has already been published openly.

The pre-course survey will help us identify who has their own dataset and who does not. We will begin working with data starting from Module 5.
