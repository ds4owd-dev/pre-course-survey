note,introduction,"Thank you for your interest in this course! Your course instructors are looking forward to meeting you. We will meet on Zoom for 10 modules, starting on **Thursday, 11th September, from 14:00 to 16:30 CET**.

Details about the content of the course can be found on the course website: [https://ds4owd-002.github.io/website/](https://ds4owd-002.github.io/website/)

**How do I sign up?**

To sign up for the course, please complete the following four steps:

**Step 1: Get an account on GitHub.**

To set up an account on GitHub, follow these general steps:

1. Go to the GitHub website at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/).
2. Click on the “Sign up” button on the top right corner of the page.
3. Enter your preferred username, email address, and password in the provided fields. (Find advice on choosing a good GitHub username here: [https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct))
4. Choose whether you want to receive updates and announcements via email.
5. Complete the verification process by solving a puzzle and entering a verification code sent to your email.

**Step 2: Register for an ORCID iD**

Create your ORCID iD at: [https://orcid.org/register](https://orcid.org/register)

**Step 3: Identify a dataset you want to work with for the capstone project**

This course follows the principle of ""open by default"". All educational resources are published openly using permissive licenses for reuse. We also apply this principle to the code and data used in the course.

At the end of the course, you will complete a capstone project, which involves analyzing a dataset of your choice. We encourage you to use data available from your company, government institution, research institute, or other personal sources. However, this requires the data to be shared openly, which may not always be possible if it is sensitive or contains personal information. In such cases, you may use a dataset that has already been published openly.

The pre-course survey will help us identify who has their own dataset and who does not. We will begin working with data starting from Module 5.

You can find examples of completed reports from the first iteration of this course here: [https://openwashdata.org/pages/academy/graduates/](https://openwashdata.org/pages/academy/graduates/)
