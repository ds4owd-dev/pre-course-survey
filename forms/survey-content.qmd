# Survey Overview

This document contains the complete content extracted from the
pre-course survey for data science for openwashdata 002. Each section
and question is presented exactly as it appears in the original form.

Thank you for your interest in this course! Your course instructors are
looking forward to meeting you. We will meet on Zoom for 10 modules,
starting on **Thursday, 11th September, from 14:00 to 16:30 CET**.

Details about the content of the course can be found on the course
website:
[https://ds4owd-002.github.io/website/](https://ds4owd-002.github.io/website/)

**How do I sign up?**

To sign up for the course, please complete the following four steps:

**Step 1: Get an account on GitHub.**

To set up an account on GitHub, follow these general steps:

1. Go to the GitHub website at
   [https://github.com/](https://github.com/).
2. Click on the "Sign up" button on the top right corner of the page.
3. Enter your preferred username, email address, and password in the
   provided fields. (Find advice on choosing a good GitHub username
   here:
   [https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct))
4. Choose whether you want to receive updates and announcements via
   email.
5. Complete the verification process by solving a puzzle and entering a
   verification code sent to your email.

**Step 2: Register for an ORCID iD**

Create your ORCID iD at:
[https://orcid.org/register](https://orcid.org/register)

**Step 3: Identify a dataset you want to work with for the capstone
project**

This course follows the principle of "open by default". All educational
resources are published openly using permissive licenses for reuse. We
also apply this principle to the code and data used in the course.

At the end of the course, you will complete a capstone project, which
involves analyzing a dataset of your choice. We encourage you to use
data available from your company, government institution, research
institute, or other personal sources. However, this requires the data to
be shared openly, which may not always be possible if it is sensitive or
contains personal information. In such cases, you may use a dataset that
has already been published openly.

The pre-course survey will help us identify who has their own dataset
and who does not. We will begin working with data starting from Module
5.

You can find examples of completed reports from the first iteration of
this course here:

**Step 4: Complete this pre-course survey**

By completing this pre-course survey, you will be registered for the
course. We will add you to an email list to keep you informed about the
next steps.
